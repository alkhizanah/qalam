# Qalam - A modal text editor

We (at Al Khizanah organization) mostly use Neovim for writing our software, however we wanted to make our own text editor to address our specific needs, with an exception that we use the same modal system implemented in Vi-like editors.

We plan to support many features out of the box, like:

1. File Manager
2. File Search
3. Language Servers Protocol
4. Syntax Highlighting

And many things that Neovim requires implementing a plugin for.

If we got to a point where these features are implemented, we then might add a plugin system using dynamic libraries instead of embedding a programming language into our editor, the idea is to make it so any programming language that can be compiled to a dynamic library be used.

This is the rough description of the project as we thought of it, many changes may be done, but the core idea must be the same: A modal text editor.
